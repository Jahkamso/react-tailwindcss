# react-tailwindcss

Setup Reactjs project with tailwindcss with just one click, without having to go through annoying configurations.

### Setup Guide
Install globally by running the command `npm i -g @jahkamso/react-tailwindcss`.

Once the installation process is completed, run this command `react-tailwindcss <project name>` to setup your react and tailwindcss project.

**NOTE:** It works perfectly when you select typescript in the vite setup options for Reactjs. Still working on JavaScript configuration.
